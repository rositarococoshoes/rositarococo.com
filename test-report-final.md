## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
No critical issues were found during testing.

### Medium Issues
1. **WhatsApp Validation Delay**: The WhatsApp validation process takes a few seconds, which might confuse users. Consider adding a more prominent loading indicator.
2. **Mobile Navigation**: On very small screens (< 320px), some elements in the header might overlap. Consider additional media queries for extreme small screens.

### Minor Issues
1. **Carousel Navigation Arrows**: On some mobile devices, the carousel navigation arrows might be slightly small for comfortable tapping. Consider increasing their size on mobile.
2. **Form Field Focus States**: The focus state for form fields could be more prominent to improve accessibility.
3. **Testimonial Carousel Speed**: The testimonial carousel auto-rotation might be slightly too fast for users to read all content. Consider slowing it down.

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider further optimizing images using WebP format for better performance
   - Implement critical CSS loading for faster initial render

2. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
   - Improve keyboard navigation for the carousel

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add a "Back to Top" button for long pages
   - Consider implementing a sticky header with cart summary on scroll
   - Add micro-interactions to improve feedback when selecting products

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Consider adding a size guide popup
   - Implement a "Recently Viewed" section
   - Add social sharing capabilities for products

The redesigned Rosita Rococó website successfully meets the requirements specified in the REDESIGN_PLAN.md.

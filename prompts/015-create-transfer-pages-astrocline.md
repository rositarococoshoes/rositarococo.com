This is for the Rosita Rococó e-commerce website where we need to create bank transfer pages within the /astrocline/ folder that:

1. **Match the aesthetic style** of the main /astrocline/ website

- @astrocline/css/ - CSS files for styling reference
- @transferenciacbu-1par/index.html - Original content source (1 pair)
- @transferenciacbu-2pares/index.html - Original content source (2 pairs)

Target pages to create/enhance:
- @astrocline/transferenciacbu-1par/index.html
- @astrocline/transferenciacbu-2pares/index.html
